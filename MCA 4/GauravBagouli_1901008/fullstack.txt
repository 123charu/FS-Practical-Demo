                                                                     Full Stack

Full-stack refers to a group of programming languages and tools a developer learns to handle both the front-end and back-end development of a website. MEAN stack, on the other hand, is a popular full-stack framework, which consists of MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, and NodeJS. 
                Full-stack isn’t necessarily restricted to a particular set of languages, while frameworks like MEAN stack is. As a full-stack developer, you’ll have to learn multiple languages related to web development along with a few concepts of web design. 
                Full-stack mainly refers to the developer, whereas MEAN stack is an acronym for a full-stack framework. Both of them are widely popular. And the demand for full stack developers  is very high. However, there are a lot of areas where these two differ, apart from the ones we’ve discussed already.
